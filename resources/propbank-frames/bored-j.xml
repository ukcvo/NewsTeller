		<note>Roleset based on instances in BOLT P01, parts 2,3.  Verbnet entry  21.2-2. Framed by Claire. I'm not actually certain that this can come up as an adj, but given the difficulty in distinguishing verbs, adjectives in English... Differs from verb frame in that instrument and cause don't seem grammatically separable for adjective.</note>

		<note>Roleset based on instances in BOLT P01, parts 2,3. Framed by Claire.  Differs from verb frame because it doesn't have args 2 (instrument) or 3 (intensifier), as neither of these seem grammatically possible with adjective.</note>
