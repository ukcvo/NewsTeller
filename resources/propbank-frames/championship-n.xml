			<note>Try your best to distinguish between eventive championships (which should be able to take args 0 and 2), and non-eventive champtionships which refer only to specific games. Examples such as this one can be fuzzy, but you can construe this one as eventive if you add an arg2, and arg2 doesn't sound particularly strange here, at least not to my ear. "He led the Penguins to two Stanley Cup championships over the Blackhawks", as opposed to "I watched hours of the national poker championships on TV"/ *"I watched hours of his national poker championships over the other players" (you could possibly utter the latter, but it changes the meaning of 'championships', see?</note>
