<text>Then Will Williams and Allen Ruff decided that free speech is n't really free and stood in front of my camera and then bum rushed me along with bald Tom Cruise . Pretty lame .</text>
<note>I can't find anything documenting whether 'bald Tom Cruise' was doing the bum-rushing, or being bum-rushed. I'm calling it ADV, but if anyone has evidence it should really be COM, let us know.</note>
