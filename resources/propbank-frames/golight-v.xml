					They-1 were attempting *PRO*-1 to go - light and were using our FMFM's to teach em techniques .
				</text>
				<note>
					This is the only example we have been able to find for this. The context is military in nature, with FMFM's possibly referring to Fleet Marine Force Manuals. It's not clear whether 'em' is an acronym or abbreviated " 'em" for 'them'. If anyone has any inside info on this, let us know.
