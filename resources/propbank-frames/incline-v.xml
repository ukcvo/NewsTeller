				The trace points back to the subject, but leave that for thesubordinated verb.  *this frame was set up under the faulty assumption that there were no active instances, but there clearly are many, for instance: "his honour inclined him to forgive." VN class has agent, patient and stimulus args, all of which occur. Of course agent would much rather be arg0 than arga, but whatchagonnnado.
