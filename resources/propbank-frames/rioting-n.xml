<note>Here, it seems like the riot was directed towards the police, but that the police weren't the ultimate reason for the riot. So we called this one GOL.</note>

<note>Arg1 added by Julia after framing riot-n.01 and realizing it can be too difficult to differentiate GOL and CAU most of the time. 2/26/13. The examples were internet examples, and I'm fairly certain the distinction didn't actually come up previously in BOLT.</note>
