<text>Both Drs. Meade and Grokest prescribed medications for him to take, and instructed him to watch his diet (to lower his cholesterol),</text>


<arg f="" n="0">his</arg>
<rel f="">diet</rel>

<note>This could be viewed as a non-event if you think of 'diet' as 'the list of foods you eat'. But it might also be rephrased as 'to watch his eating', which would be an event. So go ahead and tag if you can construe it eventively.</note>

<note>A green diet is a very specific diet, so saying 'green' tells what foods can and cannot be consumed.</note>
