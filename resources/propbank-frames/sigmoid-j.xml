<text>I discussed the development , staging , and treatment of rectosigmoid cancer with the patient and his family members , including the need to discern whether this is truly rectal or more sigmoid , as this would affect rationale for neoadjuvant chemoradiation consideration if T3 or N1 disease is noted , versus consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy as this is more sigmoid and involves lymph nodes .</text>
