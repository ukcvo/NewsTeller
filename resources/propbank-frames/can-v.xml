			<note>So one time this British gentleman took a tour of the US and visited afarm in Iowa.  Astounded at the amount of produce being grown, heasked the farmer what was done with the vegetables.  The farmerreplied, "We eat what we can, and what we can't we can."  The Britishgent thought that was terribly clever and resolved to tell his friendswhen he returned home.  When the time came, though, he couldn't quiteremember the punchline correctly and said instead, "We eat what wecan, and what we can't we do up into tins."</note>
