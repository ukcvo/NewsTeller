<text>What makes this wave of IEDs worse is that the devices are getting more effective . Frankly I 've been shocked at how good the Iraqis are with these things right from the start . I mean , after that shameful performance in GW I , did you expect these bastards to be so sneaky , patient , and smart ? I knew this war was a bad idea , but even I never realized what we 'd be up against .</text>
