					The matched items all have the same status as arguments/semantic roles.There are passives(6a) The paint is matched (by the wallpaper)(6b) The wallpaper is matched (by the paint)but these are adjectival, not verbal, as the tests show: The paint was unmatched The paint is well matched*At noon, the paint was matched by the wallpaperTherefore, (6) are predicative sentences, and the participle is an adjective, just like "peeling." So the (optional) by-phrase is an adverbial; the noun in the by-phrase is not an A0 (agent) argument.(6a) The paint is [matched (by the wallpaper)]                   AdjP(6b) The wallpaper is [matched (by the paint)]                      AdjP (And therefore these cases are not to be tagged--Paul)
