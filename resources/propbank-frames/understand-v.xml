<note>The syntax will determine the difference between the first and second examples; by all rights "John to be an idiot" should be a singleconstituent which could be called Arg1 all by itself, but there mightbe cases with extraction ("John was understood to be an idiot") orother cases where the two args are separate.  Try to keep things as asingle arg, if possible.</note>

<note>Latter examples is particularly interesting, as it's effectivelypassivized, but the utterance is apparently too big to put in subjectposition.  Cool.</note>
