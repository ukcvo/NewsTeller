<text>I suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates , and especially the ones you call tea baggers .</text>


<arg f="" n="2">voting</arg>
<rel f="">inclination</rel>
<arg f="" n="0">of the moderates</arg>
<note>"voting" doesn't tell us how arg0 is inclined to vote, just that the inclination has to do with voting. This is the difference between arg1 and arg2.</note>
