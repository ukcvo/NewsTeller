<note>Shift in annotation/examples enacted by Julia 8/16/13 so that the sufficient thing and the enabled situation are no concatenated together under arg1. (enabled situation merged with existing arg1) This was done for the sake of consistency in adjective annotation and combining n/v/j files.</note>
