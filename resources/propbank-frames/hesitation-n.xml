<text>My hesitation about vouchers lies with the whole idea that competition is good for public schools . That equates public schools with businesses , which I just do n't agree with . I ca n't consider educating children the same as running a business or competing for the market share . This might make me sound pretty dense , but how exactly are public schools supposed to " compete " with each other ?</text>
