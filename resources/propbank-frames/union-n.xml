<text>The union has demanded a 37.6 % increase in the minimum wage while De Beers 's final offer was an increase of 17 % . 

So , I discussed it with the credit union . 

FMC Corp. and Baxter International say unions also wo n't like plant relocations and needed restructuring , which means layoffs .</text>
<note>If the union is a volitional entity (organized group of people) that commits actions itself, like a labor union, it is not an event (Can you replace "union" with "the mafia"? If so, NOT AN EVENT). If it is a physical building, like a credit union (which can also refer to a group of people/organization), it is not an event!</note>
