				PReditor picks up prepositional usages of "like" (meaning "such as"and tagged as adjective) which should be ignored.  Even worse,"unlike" is picked up and included in the .arch files, so you'll seesome sentences which at first glance seem to have no "like" predicatesat all.

				This proves that "like" cannot be treated as a modal, because Englishdoesn't otherwise allow two modal verbs in a single sentences (withthe exception of certain dialects, notably Southern, which might couldsay such things).
