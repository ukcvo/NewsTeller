<note>The arg1 above would properly be "itself".  This sense is actually anextension of the other; literally 'gird' means 'to put on a belt.'Originally the belt carried one's weapons; thus to 'gird for battle'used a purpose phrase, which gradually became more prominent until thenew sense took over.</note>
