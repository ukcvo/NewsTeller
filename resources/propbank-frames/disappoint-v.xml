<note>As with 'surprise', the line between verbal passives and adjectivalsis almost nonexistent.  Note, for example, that the Ford example abovecan be easily paraphrased as "That Ford didn't move to tender a bidfor control of the company disappointed the market."  (For thisreason, the complementizer MUST be included in the arg.)</note>
