<text>He was wise to have stayed away ; it had been an unutterably dull evening.</text>

<arg f="" n="1">[He],[to have stayed away]</arg>

<note>The entity that is wise is "he stayed away,"  but the subject of this is extracted in this construction, thus requiring concatenation. Many mental ability adjectives are compatible with this.</note>
</example>
<note>Use this template if the adjective DOES NOT have an etymologically related verb (e.g. annoying --&gt; annoy).  If it does have a related verb, consult the verb roleset and follow those arguments as they are expressed by the adjective predicate.</note>

<note>These consist of a degree word and a complement (often a clause), and is compatible with any gradable adjectives.</note>

<text>But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided , it was too late to try to draw other members to his position .</text>
<note>This assumes a roleset for late where arg1 is thing that is late, and arg2 (not expressed here) is what someone/something is late for: He was late for the meeting. Notice the subtle distinction between arg2 and the "to" argument here: without the degree word, an infinitival phrase isn't grammatical: ??he was late to try to draw other members to his position.</note>
